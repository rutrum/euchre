# Euchre Tournament

I need to run a euchre tournament. I want to create a website that will let me keep track of results throughout the tournament, and make it clear who is partners with who and what table they sit at for which round.

In addition, I need to generate a valid list of matches that meet some criteria:

* Everyone is partnered with every other person once
* Everyone plays against every other person 2 times (2 opponents)
* Bye rounds are accounted for when there is a non-multiple of 4 participants

## Projects

There are multiple projects in this repository centered around euchre rotation charts.  Some of these are in progress, others are just ambitions.

* Python library and scripts that solve for rotation charts
* Typst document describing my thoughts on the problem.  Ideally this will become a formal paper.
* Scripts that convert rotation chart data produced from the python library into actual printouts.
* Scripts that generate other euchre tournament hand outs and materials, such as score sheets for each player and table tents.
* Website that will build personalized or specific euchre printouts.
