# Euchre Tournament

I need to run a euchre tournament. I want to create a website that will let me keep track of results throughout the tournament, and make it clear who is partners with who and what table they sit at for which round.

In addition, I need to generate a valid list of matches that meet some criteria:

* Everyone is partnered with every other person once
* Everyone plays against every other person 2 times (2 opponents)
* Bye rounds are accounted for when there is a non-multiple of 4 participants
